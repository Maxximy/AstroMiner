# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-18)

**Core value:** The mining-collecting-upgrading loop must feel satisfying -- hovering the circle over asteroids, watching them break apart, collecting minerals, and spending credits on meaningful upgrades that make the next run noticeably better.
**Current focus:** v1.0 MVP shipped — planning next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: v1.0 complete (6 phases, 16 plans)
Status: Milestone shipped, awaiting next milestone planning
Last activity: 2026-02-18 -- v1.0 MVP milestone archived

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 16
- Average duration: 6.6 min
- Total execution time: 1.6 hours
- Timeline: 2 days (2026-02-17 to 2026-02-18)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1.0 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Economy balance values are placeholders -- spreadsheet model needed for v1.1
- Procedural skybox shader is temporary -- real cubemap texture needed
- ASTR-03 (3D PBR models) uses programmatic materials, not final art assets

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-18
Stopped at: v1.0 MVP milestone completed and archived
Next step: `/gsd:new-milestone` for v1.1 planning
